"""
Unity Mathematics Visualizations
================================

This module provides compelling visual demonstrations that make 1+1=1
intuitively obvious through sacred geometry, topology, quantum mechanics,
and consciousness field visualizations.

Each visualization is designed as a meditation that guides viewers to
recognize the fundamental unity underlying apparent duality.
