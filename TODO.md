## üìù Notes

- **Branch Strategy**: Always work on `develop` branch, merge to `main` for production
- **Unity Principle**: Every change must preserve 1+1=1 mathematical integrity
- **Academic Standards**: Maintain rigorous mathematical proofs and documentation
- **Performance**: Optimize for phi-harmonic resonance (œÜ = 1.618033988749895)
