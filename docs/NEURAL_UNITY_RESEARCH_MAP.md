**Proof Elements**:
- Sigmoid activation functions provide universal approximation capability
- Unity constraint f(1,1) = 1 reduces approximation complexity

- Unity-specific generalization due to constraint structure
- High probability convergence guarantees

### E. Spectral Convergence Analysis
**Theorem**: Unity operators exhibit spectral convergence with dominant eigenvalue λ₁ ≈ φ.

**Spectral Properties**:
- **Spectral Radius**: ρ(A) < 1 ensures contraction mapping
- **Power Iteration**: Converges to dominant eigenvector representing unity
- **Golden Ratio Resonance**: λ₁/λ₂ ≈ φ for optimal unity operators
