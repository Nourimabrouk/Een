### ⚠️ CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED
1. **Testing Infrastructure** - Minimal test coverage (only basic MCP tests)
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** - No automated testing, building, or deployment
3. **Code Quality Tools** - No automated linting, formatting, or type checking
4. **Large Module Issue** - `omega_orchestrator.py` has 2000+ lines needing refactoring
5. **Documentation Standards** - Inconsistent docstring formats
6. **Security & Monitoring** - No security scanning or observability
