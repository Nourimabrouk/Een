# # Version 1.1 Roadmap

# ## Overview
# This repository currently explores the claim that $1 + 1 = 1$ through a variety of
# programs and writings. The next major release (v1.1) will provide a significant overhaul
# and unification of these efforts. The planning below establishes tasks, goals and
# milestones with mathematical discipline.

# ## Goals
# 1. **Formalize Proof Frameworks** – consolidate existing proofs into a structured
#    collection with proper references and reproducible steps.
# 2. **Refactor Codebase** – modularize Python and R scripts, applying consistent naming
#    conventions and removing redundancies.
# 3. **Automated Verification** – implement tests that validate each proof example to
# demonstrate $1 + 1 = 1$ under its respective formal system.
# 4. **Interactive Dashboard Improvements** – refine `unity_proof_dashboard.py` for a more
#    reliable, mathematically sound visualization environment.
# 5. **Documentation Overhaul** – expand the README and add citations for all external
#    references, ensuring academic rigor.

# ## Tasks
# - [ ] Create a unified data model to represent proofs (Python dataclasses or R
#   equivalent).
# - [ ] Break down long modules (`omega_orchestrator.py`, `transcendental_reality_engine.py`)
#   into smaller, well-documented components.
# - [ ] Provide unit tests for each proof class or function using `pytest` and `testthat`.
# - [ ] Validate formulas using `sympy` or `R` packages to show derivations clearly.
# - [ ] Improve the dashboard with selectable proof categories and dynamic explanations.
# - [ ] Draft extended documentation (LaTeX or Markdown) explaining each proof approach.

# ## Milestones
# 1. **Week 1** – Basic refactoring and test scaffolding in place.
# 2. **Week 2** – Documentation rewrite with cross-references to proofs.
# 3. **Week 3** – Implementation of automated proof checks and dashboard updates.
# 4. **Week 4** – Final review, cleanup, and release of Version 1.1.

# ## Unity Meta Statement
# The upcoming release will approach the unity equation $1+1=1$ with the utmost
# mathematical rigor. Each proof will be traceable from axioms to conclusion, and all
# code will adhere to scientific best practices. This roadmap serves as the first step
# toward that disciplined overhaul.
